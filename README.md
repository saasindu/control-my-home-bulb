# Tasmota MQTT Smart Bulb Dashboard

A robust, responsive, and self-hosted Progressive Web App (PWA) dashboard designed to control Tasmota-flashed smart bulbs via MQTT. This project is optimized for seamless one-click deployment on **Vercel**, providing a modern, intuitive interface to manage your smart lighting with real-time updates and comprehensive device information.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: Utilizes HTTP polling to keep the dashboard synchronized with the bulb's current state, ensuring a responsive user experience.
- **Power Control**: Toggle the bulb on or off with a single click.
- **Color Temperature Adjustment**: Fine-tune white balance from warm (153 mired) to cool (500 mired) for perfect ambiance.
- **RGB Color Selection**: Choose any color using an intuitive hue slider for vibrant lighting effects.
- **Brightness Control**: Adjust brightness levels from 0% to 100% to suit your environment.
- **Device Information**: Monitor critical device details, including:
  - IP address
  - Hostname
  - Firmware version
  - Module type
  - Restart reason
  - Boot count
  - Wi-Fi status
- **Secure Authentication**: Requires an API key for access, configured via environment variables for enhanced security.
- **Responsive & PWA-Compatible**: Clean, mobile-friendly UI with offline support and the ability to install as a standalone app on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Live Logs**: Toggle a live log view to debug and monitor raw MQTT communication data in real time.
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation and error logging ensure reliable operation and easy troubleshooting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend
- **Framework**: Built with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for a lightweight and scalable server.
- **MQTT Communication**: Uses [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js) to connect to an MQTT broker, subscribing to Tasmota‚Äôs `stat/`, `tele/`, and discovery topics for real-time updates and publishing to `cmnd/` topics for control.
- **Logging**: [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) provides detailed logging with timestamped JSON output and colorized console logs for development.
- **Validation**: [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) ensures safe parsing of API inputs for color temperature, brightness, and HSB color values.
- **Security**: API key-based authentication protects all control endpoints.

### Frontend
- **Static Assets**: Served from the `public` directory, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a fast, client-side experience.
- **PWA Support**: Includes a service worker and manifest for offline functionality and app-like installation.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with modern CSS (e.g., Tailwind CSS or custom styles) for a consistent experience across devices.

### MQTT Integration
- Subscribes to:
  - `stat/<MQTT_TOPIC>/+` for device status updates (e.g., power, dimmer, color).
  - `tele/<MQTT_TOPIC>/+` for telemetry data (e.g., state, info).
  - `tasmota/discovery/<TASMOTA_MAC>/config` for device discovery.
- Publishes commands to `cmnd/<MQTT_TOPIC>/<COMMAND>` for controlling power, color temperature, brightness, and HSB color.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Tasmota-flashed smart bulb configured with your MQTT broker.
- An MQTT broker (e.g., [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/), [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher) for local development.
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account for deployment.

### Environment Variables
Configure the following variables in your Vercel project settings or in a `.env` file in the project root for local development:

| Variable          | Description                                           | Example Value                | Required |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------|
